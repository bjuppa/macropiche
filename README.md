# `macropiche`
PHP tool for display of view-templates in HTML.

If you're building a pattern/component library, this simple tool will display its parts to
designers, developers, and clients for collaboration!
It's basically one helper function that you can place anywhere within your PHP:

```php
<?= macropiche('path/to/template') ?>
```

This will render an HTML `<div>` containing simple markup of:

- the file path
- the original file contents
- the processed file output as code/markup (unless equal to original file content)
- the processed file output as HTML

## Installation
> composer require fewagency/macropiche

## Background
Some reading on *display patterns* and *atomic design* - thinking that `macropiche` is designed to support:

- http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/
- http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone
- http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/

## Usage
The helper function can be used within any PHP file or PHP-based template using
`echo` or `<?=`.

```php
/**
* @param $path string Relative or absolute path to template/view file
* @param $context array|mixed Optional data for the template parser
* @return string HTML
*/
function macropiche($path, $context = null)
```

The `$context` is usually an array of variable names and values to populate the template.

## Examples
The (examples)[/examples] contains a (quick test php file)['/examples/test.php'] to get you started
and showcase the helper method used in a php file.

## Styling and scripting
The HTML generated by `macropiche` has CSS classes following the
[BEM approach for CSS naming](http://getbem.com/naming/) so you may style elements anyway you want. 

You may of course add your own scripts and styles to your document,
for example toggling display of different sections of templates.
The path display element is a good candidate for catching click events for toggling.

Adding `white-space: pre-wrap;` styling to the `<pre>` blocks within `macropiche` wraps any long lines of code nicely.

The `<code>` elements (wrapped in `<pre>`) have classes indicating the language of their contents that you can use for syntax highlighting,
e.g. `language-php` for PHP code.
This is useful with code highlighters like [Prism](http://prismjs.com).
Why not use
[the same configuration the Laravel docs use](http://prismjs.com/download.html?themes=prism&languages=markup+twig+css+clike+javascript+php+php-extras+scss+bash+sql+apacheconf+git+handlebars&plugins=line-numbers)?
Generated Prism files can also be found among the (assets of this package)[/assets] for quick use. 

The `<samp>` element is used to display the processed output, with a `<pre><code class="language-html">` inside.
It's not often one gets the opportunity to properly use `<samp>`,
this type of package must be one of the few useful applications for that poor tag!
For those of you that have not yet read
(the specification for the `<samp>` element)[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-samp-element],
I highly recommend it!

```html
<p>The computer said <samp>Too much cheese in tray two</samp> but I didn't know what that meant.</p>
```

...and if someone knows who wrote that hilarious official usage example, or where it came from, please get in touch and tell me!

## Usage with Blade and Twig templates
`macropiche` currently supports HTML and PHP template files.
We have support for Blade first in the feature pipeline, then Twig too!

## Alternatives
http://patternlab.io and http://devbridge.github.io/Styleguide/
are other ways of building your HTML component library for display.
They generate a full website, whereas this package aims to provide a simpler toolset
for displaying templates within your existing project.
