# `macropiche`
PHP tool for display of view-templates in HTML.

If you're building a pattern/component library, this simple tool will display its parts to designers, developers, and clients!
It's basically one helper function that you can place anywhere within your PHP:

```php
<?= macropiche('path/to/template') ?>
```

This will render an HTML `<div>` containing simple markup of:

- the file path
- the original file contents
- the processed file output as code (unless equal to original file content)
- the processed file output as HTML

## Installation
> composer require fewagency/macropiche

## Background
Some reading on display patterns and atomic design - thinking that `macropiche` is designed to support:

- http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/
- http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone
- http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/

## Usage
The helper function can be used within any PHP file or PHP-based template using
`echo` or `<?=`.

```php
/**
* @param $path string Relative or absolute path to template/view file
* @param $context mixed Optional data for the template parser
* @return string HTML
*/
function macropiche($path, $context = null)
```

## Styling and scripting
The HTML generated by `macropiche` has CSS classes following the
[BEM approach for CSS naming](http://getbem.com/naming/) so you may style elements anyway you want. 

The `<code>` elements have classes indicating the language of their contents that you can use for code formatting,
e.g. `language-php` for PHP code.

You may also add your own scripts, for example toggling display of different sections of templates.
The path display element is a good candidate for catching click events for toggling.

This package doesn't yet contain any convenience assets like CSS or javascript to optionally pull in to your page,
but we'll probably add that.

## Usage with Blade and Twig templates
`macropiche` currently supports HTML and PHP template files.
We have support for Blade first in the feature pipeline, then Twig too!

## Alternatives
http://patternlab.io and http://devbridge.github.io/Styleguide/ are other ways of building your HTML component library for display.
They generate a full website, whereas this package aims to provide a simpler toolset
for usage within your existing project.
